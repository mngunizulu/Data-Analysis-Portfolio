Here is an SQL query using subqueries

SELECT
D.country,
COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
COUNT(top_5_customers) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
LEFT JOIN
(SELECT
A.customer_id,
B.first_name,
B.last_name,
D.city,
E.country,
SUM(A.amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
WHERE D.city IN
(SELECT

FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id

GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 10)

ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 10)
