# Instacart-Analysis
A project generating insights for stakeholders of an online grocery store 

## Objective
Instacart is an online grocery store with a mobile app and thousands of customers. The stakeholders are interested in the customers and their spending behaviours.
As an analyst I generated customer segments for the purpose of targeted marketing efforts. I imported, cleaned, transformed and processed datasets using python.
I also grouped and aggregated data and create new variables for this purpose. Finally, using statistical tools, I created visualisations which can communicate the 
essential aspects of the datasets and provide insights for stakeholders.

- Products
